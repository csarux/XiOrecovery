# XiOrecovery
-------

Simple perl and python scripts wrapping plastimatch to recover archived XiO patient files.

To recover means to generate RT-DICOM files (CT images, RT structures, RT doses) without needing to use XiO.

The RT-DICOM files can be imported or processed by other RT systems.

An approximation to the original RT plan is generated as well.
